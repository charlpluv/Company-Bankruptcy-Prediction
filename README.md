# Company-Bankruptcy-Prediction

School Project (Python)

Instructions: We want to predict the likelihood of a company going bankrupt using a real-world dataset (Company Bankruptcy Prediction dataset) from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Please look at the UCI website available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/572/taiwanese+bankruptcy+prediction before looking at "Company_bankruptcy".pdf and the .ipynb files.
